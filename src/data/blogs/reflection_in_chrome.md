In the city of Ariston, all the luxury cars gleamed without a single visible emblem. In this world of silent motors and graceful silhouettes, no bumper bore a logo, no hood boasted a signature crest. Nonetheless, everyone knew which was which - an unspoken hierarchy whispered through rumor, media insinuations, and subtle cues so faint they might as well have been illusions. Yet these illusions shaped desire like a sculptor's hand on clay.
Cora had never owned a car like this. She made modest runs for groceries in her old hatchback, passing the polished fleets of driverless sedans that purred along the boulevards. These cars were objects of reverence: one model was said to be handcrafted by artisans who chiseled the interior panels from rare polymers; another supposedly used an engine block sourced from a discontinued lunar rover project. Everyone swore they knew which car was better. Everyone said they could tell them apart by the curve of a side mirror, the accent line on the hood, or even how the headlights blinked twice at startup. Yet no one could point to a name or a badge. They simply believed.

At the upscale cafés and rooftop lounges, whenever new cars rolled out, hushed conversations rose to fever pitch. One day, a certain emerald-hued coupe appeared on Golden Avenue. Immediately, it was christened the pinnacle of refinement - not by its maker's announcement, since no such thing existed, but by the fervor of influencers and trusted whisperers. By nightfall, half the city yearned to own this "masterpiece," as they called it. Two weeks later, a silver sedan glided past a paparazzi cluster, and without warning, opinions shifted. "The coupe looks dull next to this sedan's smooth ride," claimed a popular blogger. Millions watched a viral video of it turning a street corner so elegantly it seemed to defy physics. Before long, even those who had condemned shiny silver paint as "overdone" just a month prior were declaring it the apex of automotive design.
No one knew who built these cars or how they were distributed. Buyers never met a salesperson face-to-face. Yet the transactions happened flawlessly: cryptocurrency transfers, coded key deliveries, and instant updates to autonomous control systems. Within each new owner's garage, the car would rest, unbranded and immaculate. Friends would visit, nodding in recognition, "Ah, you got the rare pearl-tinted touring model. A fine choice." But if pressed, they could never explain how they knew.
Cora found herself drawn into the madness when she attended a coworker's party. She met Leandro, a man with sharp cheekbones and expensive shoes, who boasted of having a "transcendent" new vehicle waiting outside. Curious, Cora followed him down the sleek apartment elevator and out into the private lot. There it was: a midnight-blue sedan, luminous under the halogen floodlights. Its surfaces reflected the city's skyline, warping neon advertisements and distant satellites into abstract patterns on its lacquered panels.
At first glance, it looked no different from the other luxury autos Cora had passed a thousand times. But to Leandro's circle of friends, it was a revelation. They argued over impossible details - someone praised the angle of the door handle, another found hidden meaning in the texture of the seat fabric, as if all this subtlety amounted to divine craftsmanship. Bemused, Cora wondered if the spell could be broken. After all, didn't these people realize they were being guided by suggestion and fashion? She ran her hand along the car's hood and felt nothing but cool metal.
That night, unable to sleep, she tried to find answers. She scoured old forums and half-buried news archives. There were whispers of a conglomerate that had once branded every luxury car with a proud logo - but as market tastes shifted, they removed all insignias. They learned that mystery was more profitable than pride. Marketing firms began to feed design hints to key tastemakers, planting legends in comment threads and podcast interviews. A rumor that a certain model's airbags were made of hand-stitched microfiber would set off a frenzy, driving prices up. Next season, a rumor would position a rival model as superior. With no visible branding, consumers had to rely on hearsay, which made them hunger for status, desperate to stay ahead of the curve, and utterly dependent on the rumor mill.
By morning, Cora realized the city's obsession was fueled not by tangible differences, but by invisible branding - clever manipulations that made each car's identity a moving target. Out in the streets, drivers would crane their necks to catch a glimpse of the latest must-have machine, its prestige assigned by consensus that could change overnight.
Armed with this insight, she tried to warn others. She told her friends, "These cars are the same machines in different shades of paint! You only think one is better than the other because someone else said so." But her words fell flat. Like magpies drawn to shiny objects, the citizens of Ariston craved the newest, the finest - no matter how imaginary the distinction. They would laugh at her skepticism and move on, heads turning to follow the sleek shape of a new arrival ghosting down the avenue.
In time, Cora gave up trying to wake them. She kept her old hatchback, began walking more often, and when forced to take a ride in someone's gleaming chassis, she smiled politely but refused to praise imaginary virtues. She knew that beneath the shimmering façade was just metal, rubber, and glass. And though the rest of the city chased phantoms of prestige through featureless symbols, she would not let herself be drawn into their invisible games.
After all, she realized, these luxury cars were never truly about transportation. They were mirrors, reflecting the insecurities, the yearnings, and the pack instincts of those who followed them. And in their glossy reflections, the city saw only what it wanted to see.
